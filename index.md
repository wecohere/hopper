* [Project Backlog](https://waffle.io/zincmade/hopper)
* Current version: [0.1.1](https://github.com/zincmade/hopper/issues?q=milestone%3A0.1.0+)
* Next version: [0.2.0](https://github.com/zincmade/hopper/issues?q=milestone%3A0.2.0+)

Hopper is a modular, opinionated, convention-focused tool for your development
process.

Hopper's primary goal is to streamline switching between and contributing to a
variety of projects; regardless of language, testing library, architecture,
deployment strategy, etc. If it's a hopper-friendly project you should be able
to "hop" right in and get to work.

Hopper creates a consistent, codified interface between projects to help people
get up-to-speed and contributing fast by decreasing cognitive overhead in:
  * Initializing a new project.
  * Navigating to projects on your file system.
  * Testing a project.
  * Running a project.
  * Generating documentation.
  * Building a package from a project.
  * Pushing a packaged project to an artifact repository.
  * Bumping a version number while following semver.
  * Releasing a new version of a project.

## Installation
Once you have [node](http://nodejs.org) installed, install Hopper with `npm
install -g hopper-cli`.
