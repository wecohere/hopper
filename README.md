# Hopper
Hopper is a modular, opinionated, convention-focused tool for your development
process.

Hopper's primary goal is to streamline switching between and contributing to a
variety of projects; regardless of language, testing library, architecture,
deployment strategy, etc. If it's a hopper-friendly project you should be able
to "hop" right in and get to work.

To accomplish this, hopper focuses on common interfaces for project tasks, such as:
  * Initializing a new project.
  * Navigating to the projects on your file system.
  * Running a project
  * Testing a project
  * Generating documentation
  * Building a package from a project
  * Pushing a packaged project to an artifact repository
  * Bumping a version number while following semver
  * Releasing a new version of a project

## Installation
Once you have [node](http://nodejs.org) installed, installing Hopper is as easy
as `npm install -g hopper-cli`.

## Usage

Run `hop -h` to see a list of commands. `hop help <command>` will print out help
text for the given command.

There will be man pages soon once I figure out how to make those work.
