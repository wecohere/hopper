# Hopper
Hopper is a modular, opinionated, convention-focused tool for your development
process.

Hopper's primary goal is to streamline switching between and contributing to a
variety of projects; regardless of language, testing library, architecture,
deployment strategy, etc. If it's a hopper-friendly project you should be able
to "hop" right in and get to work.


## Usage

Run `hop -h` to see a list of commands. `hop help <command>` will print out help
text for the given command.

`man hop` opens this README and supporting documentation.

## Further Reading
More information can be found in the [online
docs](http://zincmade.github.io/hopper).
